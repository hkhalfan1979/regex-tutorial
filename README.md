# Regex Tutorial

A regular or rational expression defined as characters in a pattern or a sequence that replace or find string operations which may be useful locating a string in a URL.

## Summary

In this tutorial, I'm going to introduce one of the more commonly used Regular Expressions and, by describing how it works, explain some important regex concepts. A regex is a set of characters that defines a search pattern within a text. This can be used to find such items as usernames, emails, hex values, URLs, or HTML tags. For the purposes of this article, we are going to look at a specific example used to match emails, break it up into its various components, and explain what each component does. You can find our example below.

```
Matching an Email: /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/
```
